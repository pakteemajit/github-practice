# Reflection
## By Pakteema Jitviboon

* The steps in this project
  1. Creating a repository named "github-practice" on the github website.
  2. On terminal, using 'cd (location)' and 'git clone (my URL)' for file navigation and cloning the repository on local machine, respectively.
  3. Creating file "README.md" and "practice.txt" to learn how to use the markdown syntax.
  4. To stage and commit the changes with clear massage. For example,
    ''' git commit -m "Added README content and practice file '''
  5. Pushing into the repository using 'git push origin main'
  6. Refreshing the github page to verify the changes

Therefore, github workflow should be processed step by step (create,modify,stage,commit,push) and well-organized. This is because that markdown, used for formatting plain text, can be done efficiently.
